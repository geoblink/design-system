### Welcome to Geoblink's Design System, the source that groups all the design patterns of the Geoblink App.

The design system is so important for us because it has a direct impact on our users: it helps us to reduce inconsistencies of the app, which means that our users find less friction when using different features; it helps us to develop faster, which means that we can deliver things faster for our users; and finally, it helps us to reduce the time we spend on new joiners' onboardings, which means that we can develop more things for our users.
