### Geoblink Design System is an open source collection of components and utilities we use to build [Geoblink](https://geoblink.com) on a daily basis.

They are production-ready and provide not only some common patterns expected
from a modern high quality web application but also encourage following a
consistent style across all the features you build.

You will find not only components single-use-case-tailored components like
[GeoPrimaryButton](./#/Elements/GeoButton?id=geoprimarybutton) but also generic
and reusable components like [GeoSelectBase](./#/Elements/GeoSelect?id=geoselectbase)
on top of which we build easy-to-use components which cover the 90% of the use
cases.

But [Geoblink Design System](./) is not only about components but also about
directives like `GeoClickOutside` or brand guidelines we are proud to share
with the community.

This design system is so important for us because it has a direct impact on our
users: it helps us minimize inconsistencies in our products, which translates
in a much better user experience and a lower friction when using any of our
different features; it helps us develop new features faster, so we can deliver
enhancements and additional functionalities sooner than ever; and finally, it
helps us make it easier to welcome new joiners, cutting down the time we spend
on onboardings, and making them more efficient.
