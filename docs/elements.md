Elements are the smallest basic structures of an user interface. They cannot be broken down any further. Buttons, links, and inputs are good examples. Elements utilize decisions made on the [design token](./design-tokens.md) level.

::: tip
To add a new `Element`, use NPM script `new:component`:

```bash
npm run new:component
# alternatively
yarn new:component
```
:::

# Elements

<all-elements-list />
